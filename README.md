# Vector

Vector is an **open-source platform** that lets you create and manage an online store. It is designed to be **flexible, light-weight and extensible**.

It is split into five major components:

- The powerful Shop-API, Jason
- The frontend, Styx
- The shop-admin, Icarus
- and our Analytics-Tools, Theseus
- Achilles, the Vector-Platform

The best part is: You can build anything you like with Vector, not just shops.
